User clicked the BuyStockFragment button.
Native App sent request to the API.
API is binding BuyStockFragmentModel in appropriate controller.
Controller wants to know which UserId and StockId should be assigned to DB entry in the StockFragment table

1. Problem: Which StockId should be fragmented and asigned to user
	
	1. Solution: 
	// list of fragments corresponding to particular stocks
	// if one stock can issue only 5% of required stock fragment then
	//perhaps NEXT stock can issue the rest, and so on
	//if list of stocks.length is f.e. 3 and there is no more stocks to fragment,
	//system has to buy more stocks of the same Brand.
	//before it happends though, system (it cant hold client's account) issues as many fragments as it's 
	//capable of. User should get an email/sms as soon required stock is available and decide
	//wether or not to get more fragments of required Brand - paying Current Market Price.

2. Problem
	How we calculate remaining value of particular stock.
	Stock is 100%
	then user requires 500DKK - how do I calculate this percentage:
		- how much percent is 500DKK of 100% of Stock we have
		or
		- how much percent is 500DKK of Stock market value ?
